# Patient-Zero
A real-life simulation of a college student who has to choose between spreading an infectious disease or staying financially stable while navigating life as a student.

Patient Zero is a choice-based story game that brings players into the world of a struggling college student who has come down with a bad illness. Players must manage a limited budget and worsening health while keeping up with classes, work, and social life. Every option chosen has a financial and health impact that is shown to the player. Only after making it though the three days of illness, however, do the repercussions on others become clear. Project Zero calls attention to social determinants of health in individual and community outcomes. 

We wanted our project to invoke reflection, so we discussed various topics in current politics. As a group of computer science, design, and biomedical engineering students, we chose to integrate technology and creativity to highlight an issue in American healthcare. With the recent slashes to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, we recognized that it is now more important than ever to understand the struggle that low-income and uninsured Americans face in maintaining health. We also wanted our project to be relatable for students and completely immersive. Patient Zero combines each of our best skills to tell a story of financial and medical struggle that millions of Americans live through every day.
